A simple reactjs file upload library that is used to upload files to Supabase Storage, for now. This library was built on top of react-drag-drop-files [download-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/react-drag-drop-files . It is a light and simple reactjs drag and drop files library to use with very flexible options to change, so you put whatever the design you want for your drop-area. Users can drag and drop or even select the file anywhere in the window.
